This is a work in progress / experiment. The charts here have been written against very simple data sets and
as such are not entirely reliable for real use. Depending on the structure of your reports, they probably won't
tell you anything useful. Hopefully they'll show data after you authenticate.

### Usage

Clicking on a link to view a report's display for the first time will prompt you to:

a. Log in with Salesforce if you aren't already
b. Authorize the application to pull data and a list of your most recently viewed reports.

After this, any subsequent views will (at the most) ask you to log in to salesforce, then display the page.
